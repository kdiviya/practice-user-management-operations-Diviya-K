I practiced below SQL operations using MySQL Workbench,

1. Created schemas and tables with specified columns using MySQL workbench.
2. Used the INSERT clause to add data into the corresponding table columns.
3. Applied the UPDATE clause, to modify specific rows using the WHERE clause and also to update all rows when no WHERE clause was provided.
4. Retrieved data using the SELECT clause, using SELECT * to get all columns or selected specific columns using column names.
5. Used the WHERE clause to filter results based on conditions.
6. Applied conditional operators such as AND, OR, and NOT to combine multiple conditions in queries.
7. Sorted results using the ORDER BY clause with ASC (ascending order) & DESC (descending order).
8. Limited result output using the LIMIT clause to display a specific number of rows.
9. Used the OFFSET clause to specify an offset to start from.
10.Used the AS keyword to assign aliases to columns.

When trying to update or delete rows without using a key in the WHERE clause, I encountered errors. One of the most challenging parts for me was learning how to disable safe mode  and restart the connection.
