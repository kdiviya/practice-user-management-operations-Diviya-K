Practice 1:

I practiced below SQL operations using MySQL Workbench,

1. Created schemas and tables with specified columns using MySQL workbench.
2. Used the INSERT clause to add data into the corresponding table columns.
3. Applied the UPDATE clause, to modify specific rows using the WHERE clause and also to update all rows when no WHERE clause was provided.
4. Retrieved data using the SELECT clause, using SELECT * to get all columns or selected specific columns using column names.
5. Used the WHERE clause to filter results based on conditions.
6. Applied conditional operators such as AND, OR, and NOT to combine multiple conditions in queries.
7. Sorted results using the ORDER BY clause with ASC (ascending order) & DESC (descending order).
8. Limited result output using the LIMIT clause to display a specific number of rows.
9. Used the OFFSET clause to specify an offset to start from.
10.Used the AS keyword to assign aliases to columns.

When trying to update or delete rows without using a key in the WHERE clause, I encountered errors. One of the most challenging parts for me was learning how to disable safe mode and restart the connection.


Practice 2:

○ What did you learn? I learned advanced sql queries such as GROUP BY which is used for aggregate operation such as MIN, MAX, AVG, SUM  & COUNT and how to filter the data using WHERE and HAVING clause.  Also I learned about  joins such as INNER, LEFT OUTER, RIGHT OUTER JOINS to display the matching data and subqueries  such as scalar(returns single row and column), column (returns multiple rows and single column), table(returns multiple rows and multiple columns).

○ What was most challenging?
The most challenging part was subqueries because how the subquery is executed and how it passed as an argument to the main query is little bit tricky, since it has multiple types such as column, table and scalar subqueries.
